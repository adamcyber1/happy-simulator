class SpikeProfile(Profile):
    """
    SpikeProfile simulates an event profile with a spike pattern.

    Parameters:
    - rampup_start (Time): The time when the ramp-up phase starts.
    - rampdown_start (Time): The time when the ramp-down phase starts.
    - starting_rate (float): The initial rate of requests before the ramp-up.
    - rampup_factor (float): The rate at which the request rate increases during the ramp-up phase.
    - rampdown_factor (float, optional): The rate at which the request rate decreases during the ramp-down phase. Defaults to 1.

    Attributes:
    - rampup_start (Time): The time when the ramp-up phase starts.
    - rampdown_start (Time): The time when the ramp-down phase starts.
    - starting_rate (float): The initial rate of requests before the ramp-up.
    - rampup_factor (float): The rate at which the request rate increases during the ramp-up phase.
    - rampdown_factor (float): The rate at which the request rate decreases during the ramp-down phase.
    - peak_rate (float): The peak request rate during the ramp-down phase.

    Methods:
    - get_rate(time: Time) -> float: Returns the request rate at a given time.
